Bus Station Project

Furthermore, it facilitates for the managers viewing all the trips  available in the station and assigning trips to drivers.


Work Distribution:
We used github in sharing any updates and modifications.
We distributed the work by classes, but we worked together in modifying each class and in handling errors.
